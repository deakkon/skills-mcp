"""
skill-mcp local server - Python FastMCP entry point.

This is the **local development** server. The production server is the
Cloudflare Worker in src/worker.py - deploy it with `wrangler deploy`.

Use this local server when you need script execution support: the Worker
runs on Cloudflare's Python (Pyodide) runtime which cannot spawn subprocesses,
so `skills_run_script` execution mode requires running locally.

Seven MCP tools:
  skills_find_relevant  - semantic search (via Cloudflare Workers AI REST API)
  skills_list_all       - browse full catalogue without search
  skills_get_body       - full instructions + tier3_manifest
  skills_get_options    - config variants, dependencies, limitations
  skills_get_reference  - fetch a reference markdown file
  skills_run_script     - execute a bundled script (sandboxed subprocess)
  skills_get_asset      - fetch a template or static resource

Transport (set MCP_TRANSPORT env var):
  stdio            (default) - Claude Code, Cursor, any local MCP client
  streamable-http            - networked / remote use

Required env vars (.env):
  QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY  - Qdrant Cloud credentials
  WORKERS_AI_ACCOUNT_ID, WORKERS_AI_API_TOKEN - Cloudflare credentials (for embedding)
